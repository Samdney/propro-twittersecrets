## Synopsis
*Starting in 2006, Twitter has become one of the most used social networking services worldwide with about 321 million active users [1]. Hence, it has reached an important role in modern communication for people and also their right for free speach. Since, not for all people the right for free speach and freedom of expression is to be given, we will investigate in possible ways, apart from obvious plain Tweets and direct messages, how Twitter can be used for secret data sharing and data transfer, in this project.*
